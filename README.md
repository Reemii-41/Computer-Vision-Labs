# Computer-Vision-Labs
Welcome to the Computer Vision Lab series! This repository contains a series of five pivotal labs focusing on various aspects of computer vision. Each lab provides hands-on experience, comprehensive explanations, and illustrative code examples.

# Labs Overview:
  1- Image Classification: Utilizes TensorFlow with the Flowers dataset to implement a Sequential model for image classification.
  2- Image Stitching: Utilizes OpenCV (cv2) for merging images seamlessly to create panoramic views.
  3- Image Matching: Implements the DELF Model for feature extraction and matching to align images accurately.
  4- Feature Detection: 
    •	Learn how to detect image features and add labeled boxes with formatted scores and label names.
    •	Learn how to do timed detection for multiple images. 
  5- Feature Extraction: Implements various feature extraction techniques:
    •	Feature extraction using SIFT
    •	Feature extraction using ORB
    •	Feature extraction using BRISK
